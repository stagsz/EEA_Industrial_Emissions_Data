Management summary 
India experiences a WtE boom, mainly driven by waste disposal problems, new waste management handling 
rules, and governmental incentives. However, most projects still continue to fail, amongst others, due to 
uncertain project financing conditions. Neverthe less, we expect the Indian market to grow steadily by an 
average of 0.8 million tonnes annually with 2 to 5 commissionings per year.  
 
Background / market factors / legal framework 
India is the most populated country in the world. The 2021 decennial census has been postponed several 
times and the process is now expected to start in 2025. The population data will be announced by 2026. This 
is impacting the quality of all government statistical surveys, as they are still based on the 2011 census. India’s 
annual population growth has averaged 1.2% since 2011, down from 1.7% in the previous decade, as 
government data shows. 
Even though the share of people living in urban agglomerations has increased in recent years, India still is a 
very rural country, even when compared to other emerging countries such as China or Indonesia.  
The administration of an area in urban India is called urban local body (ULB). For the WtE market, the most 
important ULBs are the Municipal Cooperations (Nagar Nigam/Mahanagar Palika) that administer larger urban 
areas. 
For the future, all available prognoses expect a strong increase of waste amounts in India, as a result of the 
country’s growing population, its economic growth, and higher shares of collected MSW.  
There is no reliable data on waste amounts available, at least not at the national level. In its annual 
implementation report on waste legislation, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) requires certain waste 
data from the federal states and union territories. According to the CPCB report for 2021/2022, total MSW 
amounts sum up to more than 150,847 tpd or 55.06 million tpy.  
However, it is noted that this information only includes the collected waste – and not the waste that was 
produced. In addition, the collected waste does not reflect those waste amounts that are collected by the 
informal sector due to their value as a secondary raw material, e.g. plastic or paper.

We do not know of further landfill reduction rules in individual states. On a national level no targets for material 
recycling have been agreed so far and we do not know of any federal state who has done this on a state-wide 
level either. 
In 2012, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) recognized recovery of MSW as a renewable 
energy source. 
The Central Government’s program Swachh Bharat Abhiyan  (“Clean India Mission”), which started in 2014, 
was covering investments of 620 billion INR (8.4 billion EUR). Under this program,  the Ministry of Urban 
Development (MoUD) has received 53 proposals for the construction of WtE plants (electric generation 
capacity of 400 MW) from 22 Indian states. As of December 2023, according to the Central Government, the 
solid waste processing capacity had increased by around 38.6 million annual tonnes during first 8 years under 
the programme. 
There are various ministries dealing with WtE: 
- The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is the policy -making body and 
concerned with determining policies and rules/directives, such as what types of waste can be used for 
WtE, calorific values, etc.  
- The Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD funds the projects. A certain amount is budgeted for 
projects and state governments may submit proposals to receive funding from this budget allocation.  
- The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has its own scheme for WtE projects and its own 
budget to fund these projects.  
The main incentives for WtE facilities, however, result from feed -in tariffs (FITs) in single states. FITs are not 
mandatory, but most state Electricity Regulatory Commissions (ERCs) have adopted them. However, it is not 
possible to give details on all the funding schemes of the different federal states in this report. 
States are allowed to alter the FITs as per their requirements. The FITs of most WtE plants in India range 
between INR 6 to 8/kWh (EUR 0.067 to 0.089), which are determined in regard to the regulations of the state 
ERCs. Some states have introduced flexibl e tariffs that rely, amongst others, on the size and the capital 
expense of a project. The ERCs are responsible for both conventional and non -conventional (including WtE) 
sources.  
In October 2024, the Central Government approved the target sectors for India’s new Carbon Credit and 
Trading Scheme (CCTS), which is expected to be launched in the 2026-27 financial year. In phase I, the sector 
“waste handling and disposal” will be included in the CCTS. However, as of October 2024, it remains unclear 
whether WtE plants will also be covered by the scheme. 
 
Plants 
As of October 2024, according to our database, 19 WtE plants are active in India with a combined capacity of 
around 3.9 mtpy. In 2020, we made a larger review of the existing plant asset which explains the decline from 
2019 to 2020 in our forecast graph.

Indonesia 
Last update: 10-2024

Management summary 
Driven by a robust economy and growing population, Indonesia could be an interesting WtE market in the 
future, if the regulatory framework is upheld. However, several obstacles remain, like the still slow project 
development and several uncertainties, e.g.  on financing. A regulation from 2018 aims for at least 12 plants 
but only 2 of them became operational until today. 
 
Background / market factors / legal framework 
Indonesia's gross domestic product growth is forecast to average 5.1% per year from 2024 to 2026. The 
country’s economic growth has resulted in increasing waste amounts, especially in metropolitan regions.  
The progress in waste management in Indonesia still focuses to a great extent on institution building, collecting 
reliable data on waste volumes and increasing the waste treatment share.  
According to the National Waste Management Information System (SIPSN), household waste and similar 
amounts increased from 36.2 million tonnes in 2022 to 38.4 million tonnes in 2023. Of this amount, the largest 
share (39.7%) was food waste.  
Ever since the first national waste law came into force in 2008, different laws and regulations for more detailed 
issues came into force, such as the Government Regulation (GR) 81/2019 on household waste and household 
waste like waste management. The Presidential Regulation (PR) 97/2017 defines a waste reduction target of 
30% between 2017 and 2025. Moreover, a waste treatment rate of 70% is targeted. In 2023, however, less 
waste was treated: 23.7 million tonnes (61.6%), compared to 23.2 million tonnes (64%) in 2022. A breakdown 
into different types of treatment is not available.  
Waste-to-Energy has been established as a National Strategic Program in the President Decree 58/2017. 
According to its National Electric Generation Plan 2021 -2030 (RUPTL), state -owned utility PT Perusahaan 
Listrik Negara (PLN) aims at reaching 277.5 MW in WtE capacities in 2030. Moreover, waste incineration has 
been added to Indonesia’s 2021 updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which includes the 
country’s emissions reduction goals under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.  
The Presidential Regulation No 35/2018 regards the acceleration of the thermal treatment of solid waste. 
Within this regulation, 12 cities are targeted as future location of WtE plants: Jakarta, Tangerang, South 
Tangerang, Bekasi, Bandung, Semarang, Suraka rta, Surabaya, Makassar, Denpasar, Palembang and 
Manado. It replaced the form regulation 18/2016 in which 7 cities were named.
