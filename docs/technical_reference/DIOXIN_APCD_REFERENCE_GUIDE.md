# GMAB Dioxin/PCDD/PCDF Control & APCD Technology Reference Guide

## OVERVIEW
This guide provides comprehensive reference for dioxin control strategy, APCD technology, and regulatory compliance for waste-to-energy plants.

## PART 1: DIOXIN FUNDAMENTALS

### What are Dioxins?
- **PCDD**: Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins
- **PCDF**: Polychlorinated dibenzofurans
- **DIOXINS**: Collective term for PCDD + PCDF + PCBs (in some contexts)

### I-TEQ / TEQ (Toxicity Equivalent Quantity)
- **I-TEQ**: International Toxicity Equivalent Quantity
- **TEQ**: Toxicity Equivalent (TCDD-equivalent)
- Measures dioxin potency relative to TCDD (most toxic congener = 1.0)
- **EU LIMIT**: 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm³ for waste incinerators
- Lower concentrations = lower health risk

### Health & Environmental Impacts
- **EXTREMELY TOXIC** even at ng (nanogram) concentrations
- Bioaccumulation in food chain → persistent in environment
- Immune system suppression, cancer risk, reproductive harm
- Workers and public exposure risk from incinerator emissions
- **REGULATORY DRIVER**: Enforceable with severe penalties

## PART 2: DIOXIN FORMATION MECHANISMS IN WASTE INCINERATORS

### 1. De Novo Synthesis
- **What**: Dioxins formed during flue gas cooling (200-400°C zone)
- **Trigger**: Cooling of combustion products in specific temperature range
- **Key Factor**: Presence of chlorine source (plastics, salt in waste) + carbon
- **Prevention**:
  - Cool flue gas RAPIDLY through 200-400°C zone (minimize residence time)
  - Target: <10 seconds in critical zone
  - Alternative: Keep temps >400°C until below 200°C

**GMAB SOLUTION**: Temperature control units that bypass critical zone

### 2. Memory Effect
- **What**: Adsorbed dioxins on ash/deposits released during next operating cycle
- **Trigger**: Inconsistent or poor emission control, plant shutdowns
- **Accumulation**: Previous violations leave residual dioxins = future violations
- **Risk**: Even "cleaned" plants can spike dioxin if memory effect not addressed
- **Timeline**: Can persist months or years

**GMAB SOLUTION**:
- Activated carbon injection targets adsorbed dioxins
- Optimized residence times prevent re-adsorption
- Regular cleaning/replacement protocols

### 3. Back-End Formation
- **What**: Dioxins form IN the emission control device (fabric filters, hoppers)
- **Cause**: Temperature conditions, chemical reactions during collection
- **Risk**: Control device becomes source of dioxin if not properly designed

**GMAB SOLUTION**: Integrated fabric filter design with temperature control

## PART 3: APCD (AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICE) TECHNOLOGY

### APCD Components for Dioxin Control

#### 1. Activated Carbon Injection (ACI)
- **Purpose**: Adsorb gaseous and semi-volatile dioxins
- **Method**: Inject powdered activated carbon into flue gas stream (pre-filter)
- **Effectiveness**: 85-95% dioxin capture
- **Residence Time**: Minimum 10 seconds at optimal temperature
- **Cost**: Medium-range, highly effective

**GMAB Integration**: Automated injection system with flow monitoring

#### 2. Fabric Filter Baghouse
- **Purpose**: Capture dioxin-laden carbon particles + dust
- **Additional Benefit**: Removes particulate matter (dust)
- **Design Feature**: Prevents thermal back-end formation
- **Replacement**: Regular bag changes (every 6-12 months depending on waste)
- **Cost**: Higher initial, reliable operation

**GMAB Integration**: Dioxin-optimized baghouse with temperature sensors

#### 3. Temperature Control Unit
- **Purpose**: Prevent de novo synthesis in critical 200-400°C zone
- **Methods**:
  - Rapid cooling quench (pass through zone <5 seconds)
  - Heat recovery economizer (extract heat, cool gas rapidly)
  - Evaporative cooling if needed
- **Target**: Gas exits < 200°C or stays > 400°C until cooling complete

**GMAB Integration**: Economizer + rapid cooling system (bonus: energy recovery!)

#### 4. I-TEQ/TEQ Continuous Emission Monitoring (CEM)
- **Purpose**: Real-time dioxin measurement for compliance verification
- **Technology**: Semi-continuous monitoring (SCCEM) or continuous sampling
- **Frequency**: Hourly or 30-minute intervals
- **Data**: Auto-recorded for regulatory submission
- **Cost**: Significant but MANDATORY for compliance

**GMAB Integration**: Automatic CEM system with cloud data upload

#### 5. Flue Gas Conditioning
- **Purpose**: Optimize conditions for carbon adsorption
- **Methods**: Control humidity (50-60% optimal), temperature (~150°C)
- **Benefit**: Improves carbon effectiveness, reduces OPEX

**GMAB Integration**: Moisture and temperature sensors with automatic control

---

## PART 4: REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

### EU Industrial Emissions Directive (IED)
- **Applies to**: Waste incineration, RDF plants, biomass incinerators
- **Dioxin Limit**: 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm³ (annual average)
- **Averaging Period**: Monthly or annual (facility-dependent)
- **Measurement**: Isokinetic sampling, lab analysis (ISO methods)

### BAT (Best Available Techniques) Conclusions
- **2019 BAT Conclusions**: Latest EU guidance for incinerators
- **Dioxin BAT**: <0.05 ng I-TEQ/Nm³ (more stringent than legal limit)
- **New BAT Deadline**: 2023 (already expired for most plants)
- **Compliance Path**: Must show progress toward BAT or justify deviations

### Enforcement Actions
- **Administrative Fines**: €5,000-€50,000+ per violation (EU member states)
- **Criminal Penalties**: Potential jail time for repeat violations
- **Production Bans**: Can shut down plant for non-compliance
- **Remediation Orders**: Forced APCD installation + costs

## PART 5: GMAB DIOXIN CONTROL STRATEGY

### Integrated Approach: APCD + Energy Recovery
```
WASTE INCINERATION
       ↓
    BOILER (Heat extraction)
       ↓
  FLUE GAS ~400°C
       ↓
  ↓← ECONOMIZER (Extract heat for energy recovery)
  ↓   Gas temperature: 400°C → 200°C RAPIDLY (prevent de novo)
  ↓
  ↓← ACTIVATED CARBON INJECTION (Capture gaseous dioxins)
  ↓   Contact time: 10+ seconds
  ↓
  ↓← FABRIC FILTER (Capture carbon + particles)
  ↓   Temperature monitoring (prevent back-end formation)
  ↓
  ↓← HEAT RECOVERY BOOSTER (Optional: recover additional heat)
  ↓   Temperature now safe for heat recovery: <150°C
  ↓
  ↓← I-TEQ/TEQ MONITORING (Verify compliance)
  ↓
  CLEAN EMISSIONS → Atmosphere (<0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm³)

  ENERGY RECOVERED → Electricity + district heating revenue
```

### Why GMAB is Different
1. **Integrated Design**: APCD + heat recovery in single system
   - No space for separate equipment
   - Cost savings vs. separate installations
   - Optimized temperature profile for both functions

2. **De Novo Prevention**: Temperature control during cooling
   - Proprietary rapid-quench technology
   - Prevents dioxin formation (not just capture)
   - More reliable than post-formation capture alone

3. **Memory Effect Mitigation**: Advanced carbon injection protocol
   - Continuous dosing (not just during violations)
   - Targets adsorbed dioxins on equipment
   - Long-term compliance assurance

4. **Energy Value**: Compliance that ALSO generates revenue
   - ORC system for electricity from captured heat
   - District heating integration
   - ROI improves APCD economics

## PART 6: SALES & POSITIONING

### Target Customer Profile
- **Primary Decision Maker**: Environmental/HSE Director (compliance-focused)
- **Secondary**: Plant Manager (operations), CFO (economics)
- **Trigger**: Recent dioxin violation, enforcement action, BAT deadline

### Key Message Framework
1. **Health/Compliance First**: "Eliminate dioxin health risk, ensure regulatory compliance"
2. **Regulatory Risk**: "Avoid €5M+ enforcement penalties, production shutdowns"
3. **Integrated Value**: "Compliance solution that generates energy revenue"

### Lead Scoring (DIOXIN-FOCUSED)
```
DIOXIN CRITICAL (40+ points) → PRIORITY 1: IMMEDIATE 48-hour outreach
DIOXIN APPROACHING (25-35 pts) → PRIORITY 2: 1-2 week outreach
DIOXIN AT-RISK (15-24 pts) → PRIORITY 3: Proactive positioning
```

### Objection Handling
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We're already compliant" | "BAT requires 0.05 limit (lower than legal 0.1). Also, memory effect can cause future violations without preventive APCD." |
| "APCD is too expensive" | "EU grants cover 60%, cost avoided penalties (€5M+), energy recovery pays 20-30% of CAPEX over 5 years." |
| "Can we just monitor and fix violations?" | "Dioxins accumulate (memory effect). Once violated, next cycle likely violates again. Proactive APCD eliminates cycle." |
| "Our current filter is enough" | "Fabric filters alone capture particles but not gaseous dioxins (35-40% of total). Need ACI for complete control." |

## APPENDIX: COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Can't facilities just measure and fix violations after the fact?**
A: No. Dioxins are persistent (memory effect). Once a facility violates, residual dioxins remain and cause future violations even after initial fix. Proactive APCD is mandatory.

**Q: Is 0.1 ng/Nm³ safe?**
A: EU limit of 0.1 is regulatory standard, but GMAB targets BAT level 0.05 for margin of safety. Lower is always safer.

**Q: How often does APCD need maintenance?**
A: Activated carbon needs replacement every 6-12 months depending on waste type. Baghouse bags need replacement every 12-18 months. CEM needs quarterly servicing.

**Q: Can we upgrade just the baghouse?**
A: Baghouse alone is insufficient for dioxin control. Must include ACI system + temperature control. Partial upgrades risk remaining dioxin sources.
