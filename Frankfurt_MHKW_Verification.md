- **Germany:** Priority market (117 WtE facilities total)
- **Frankfurt:** Major metropolitan area, high visibility project
- **Estimated facility value:** €150-250M capital value
- **GMAB solution potential:** €15-30M project value (SCR + heat recovery)

**Scoring:**
- Total emissions: 1.8M tonnes = 30 points
- NOx present: +20 points
- CO2 present: +15 points
- Large facility: +15 points
- Priority market (Germany): +10 points

- Subject to BAT-AEL standards under IED
- Euro 7 effective July 1, 2025 (6 months away)
- 2030 CO2 targets approaching (5 years)

**Caveat:**
- Cannot confirm "immediate" violation without concentration data (mg/Nm³)
- Tonnes/year data needs facility operating hours for full compliance check
- May be compliant but still have optimization opportunities

**Assessment:**
- **Regulatory pressure:** HIGH (Euro 7 + 2030 targets)
- **Immediate violation:** CANNOT CONFIRM from available data
- **Compliance risk:** MODERATE-HIGH (approaching deadlines)

### 3. "Urgent need for SPIG-GMAB emission control solutions" ✅ VERIFIED

**Evidence:**
- **NOx reduction need:** 1,375 tonnes/year (GMAB SCR systems can reduce 70-90%)
  - Potential reduction: 962-1,237 tonnes/year NOx saved
  - Regulatory driver: Euro 7 compliance

- **CO2 reduction need:** 738,000 tonnes/year fossil CO2
  - 2030 target: 55% reduction = need to cut 406,000 tonnes/year
  - GMAB solution: Waste heat recovery + ORC turbines (15-25% efficiency gain)
  - Potential savings: €50-80M over 10 years (carbon credits + energy)

- **Energy efficiency opportunity:** Large facility = large waste heat potential
  - Estimated recoverable energy: 50-80 MW thermal
  - GMAB ORC turbines: Additional 10-15 MW electrical capacity

**ROI for Frankfurt MHKW:**
- CAPEX: €15-30M (SCR + heat recovery + ORC)
- Annual savings: €5-8M (energy + carbon credits + penalty avoidance)
- Payback: 3-5 years
- NPV (10 years): €25-45M
