# EU Emissions Standards & Restrictions

## Overview
This document outlines current and upcoming EU emissions standards for vehicles and industrial applications. These standards represent key compliance requirements for companies in the emissions control and energy efficiency business.

## Euro Exhaust Emission Standards (Light-Duty Vehicles)

### Current Standard: Euro 6 (2014-Present)
**Latest Revision: Euro 6e (2022)**

#### Petrol Vehicles Limits:
- **CO (Carbon Monoxide)**: 1.0 g/km
- **HC (Hydrocarbons)**: 0.10 g/km
- **NOx (Nitrogen Oxides)**: 0.06 g/km
- **PM (Particulate Matter)**: 0.005 g/km (direct injection engines only)
- **PN (Particulate Number)**: 6.0 × 10¹¹ particles/km (direct injection engines)

#### Diesel Vehicles Limits:
- **CO (Carbon Monoxide)**: 0.50 g/km
- **HC+NOx (Combined)**: 0.17 g/km
- **NOx (Nitrogen Oxides)**: 0.08 g/km
- **PM (Particulate Matter)**: 0.005 g/km
- **PN (Particulate Number)**: 6.0 × 10¹¹ particles/km

### Upcoming Standard: Euro 7
**Implementation Date**: 1 July 2025

#### Key Changes:
- Includes **non-exhaust emissions** (brake wear and tire abrasion)
- Stricter limits on NOx and particulate matter
- Real-world driving emissions testing expansion
- Non-exhaust emissions from tires and brakes now regulated
- Continued monitoring of in-use vehicle emissions

## CO₂ Emission Standards (Passenger Cars & Vans)

### Fleet-Wide Targets 2025-2030

#### 2025 Targets (Current):
- **Passenger Cars**: 95 g CO₂/km fleet average
- **Light Commercial Vehicles (Vans)**: 147 g CO₂/km fleet average

#### 2030 Targets:
- **Passenger Cars**: 55% reduction compared to 2021 baseline
- **Light Commercial Vehicles**: 50% reduction compared to 2021 baseline

#### 2035 Targets:
- **All New Vehicles**: 100% emission reduction (zero-emission only)
- This means only zero-emission vehicles can be registered from 2035

### Manufacturer Compliance Requirements:
- Individual manufacturers have specific CO₂ targets based on vehicle weight and fleet composition
- **Excess Emissions Penalty**: EUR 95 per g/km for each non-compliant vehicle registered
- **Super-Credits**: Zero and low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs) earn credits when exceeding 25% benchmark for cars and 17% for vans
- Three-year rolling average compliance mechanism

## Historical Euro Standards Timeline

| Standard | Year Introduced | Key Changes |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Euro 1 | 1992 | Initial standards; catalytic converters mandatory; unleaded petrol required |
| Euro 2 | 1996 | Reduced CO and HC+NOx limits; different petrol/diesel standards |
| Euro 3 | 2001 | Separate NOx limits; more realistic test procedures |
| Euro 4 | 2005 | Further NOx/CO reductions; encourages diesel particle filters |
| Euro 5 | 2009 | First PM limit on direct injection petrol engines |
| Euro 6 | 2014 | Strictest standards to date; Real Driving Emissions (RDE) testing |
| Euro 6d | 2017 | Enhanced RDE testing |
| Euro 6e | 2022 | Further refinements |
| **Euro 7** | **2025** | **Non-exhaust emissions included** |

## Testing Procedures

### Current Test Cycle:
- **WLTP** (Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Vehicles Test Procedure)
- Replaced older NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) testing
- Real-world driving emissions (RDE) testing with portable emission measurement systems (PEMS)

### Euro 7 Testing (New):
- **UN Regulation No. 154**: Laboratory exhaust emissions measurements
- **UN Regulation 168**: Real Driving Emissions (RDE) testing
- **UN Global Technical Regulation No. 24**: Brake particle emissions testing
- Tire abrasion limits based on UN WP.29 methodologies

---

## Non-Exhaust Emissions (Euro 7 & Beyond)

### Brake Wear Emissions:
- Particulates from brake wear now regulated
- Testing standard: UN GTR No. 24
- Different limits for electric vs. conventional vehicles (through 2030)

### Tire Abrasion Emissions:
- Tire wear particles now subject to limits
- C1 tire abrasion based on UN WP.29 testing methodologies
- First time tire emissions are regulated at EU level
