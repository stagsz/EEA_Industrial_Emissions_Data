### 2. Working Lead Finder Scripts

#### A. [simple_compliance_lead_finder.py](simple_compliance_lead_finder.py) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Use this one!

**What it does:**
- Loads real EEA Industrial Emissions Database
- Filters 765 waste-to-energy facilities across Europe
- Analyzes pollutant emissions (NOx, CO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, etc.)
- Scores facilities based on:
  - Total emission levels (0-30 points)
  - Number of pollutant types (0-20 points)
  - Key pollutants present: NOx (+20), CO‚ÇÇ (+15), SO‚ÇÇ (+15)
  - Facility size (0-15 points)
  - Priority market (0-10 points)

**Latest Results:**
- **139 qualified leads** from 200 facilities processed
- **48 Priority 1 leads** (score 80+)
- **28 Priority 2 leads** (score 60-79)
- **46 Priority 3 leads** (score 40-59)
- **76 facilities with NOx emissions** (regulatory concern)
- **89 facilities with CO‚ÇÇ emissions**
- **21 facilities with SO‚ÇÇ emissions** (requires scrubbing)

**Output File:** `GMAB_WtE_Leads_Simple_20251019.xlsx`

**Excel Sheets:**
1. Priority 1 (80+) - 48 facilities
2. Priority 2 (60-79) - 28 facilities
3. Priority 3 (40-59) - 46 facilities
4. Priority 4 (30-39) - 3 facilities
5. ALL LEADS - Complete dataset
6-10. Top 5 countries (FR, DK, CH, ES, DE)

**How to run:**
```bash
python simple_compliance_lead_finder.py
```

#### B. [waste_to_energy_lead_finder.py](waste_to_energy_lead_finder.py)
**Status:** ‚úÖ UPDATED with compliance integration (not yet tested with real violations)

**What it does:**
- Full integration with emission_compliance_checker module
- Checks facilities against EU BAT-AEL limits
- Compliance-first scoring
- Detailed compliance violation context

**Note:** Works, but current EEA data doesn't have enough facilities exceeding BAT-AEL limits to demonstrate full compliance violation features. Best for future use when data includes more non-compliant facilities.

#### C. [compliance_lead_finder.py](compliance_lead_finder.py)
**Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING (minimal violations found in current data)

**What it does:**
- Full compliance checking with detailed violation analysis
- Works with real EEA data
- Generates detailed compliance reasons

**Note:** Found 66 facilities with emissions but most are compliant (score 10). This is accurate - most European waste incinerators ARE compliant with current standards.

#### D. [lead_generation_agent_UPDATED.py](lead_generation_agent_UPDATED.py)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è HAS ISSUES with Claude Agent SDK setup

**What it would do:**
- AI agent orchestration
- Real EEA data integration
- Compliance-first scoring
- Detailed analysis

**Issue:** MCP server stdin error - SDK configuration issue
**Workaround:** Use simple_compliance_lead_finder.py instead

## üìã DETAILED COMPLIANCE REASONS

### Example from emission_compliance_checker.py:

```
CRITICAL VIOLATION - 1 emission violation(s) detected | LARGE FACILITY

COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ NOx: 450.0 tonnes/year (+28.6% vs BAT-AEL Waste Incineration)

REGULATORY URGENCY: 90 days until BAT-AEL enforcement deadline

FINANCIAL RISK: SEVERE: Potential facility shutdown orders, operating permit
suspension, fines up to EUR 500,000+ in NL

GMAB SOLUTION OPPORTUNITY: GMAB SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system +
Advanced combustion optimization = 70-90% NOx reduction. Proven in 50+ WtE
installations. Typical ROI: 2-3 years.

WHY THIS SCORE (100/100):
   ‚Ä¢ Base Violation Severity: 100 points (CRITICAL VIOLATION)
   ‚Ä¢ Multiple Violations Bonus: +0 points (1 violation)
   ‚Ä¢ Facility Size Factor: +20 points (LARGE FACILITY, 3500 TJ/year)

SALES STRATEGY:
   ‚Ä¢ Lead with regulatory compliance urgency (deadline in 90 days)
   ‚Ä¢ Emphasize penalty avoidance (potential fines/enforcement action)
   ‚Ä¢ Position GMAB's proven emission control solutions (50+ WtE installations)
   ‚Ä¢ Offer immediate technical assessment and fast-track implementation
   ‚Ä¢ Highlight co-benefits: energy efficiency gains + emission compliance
