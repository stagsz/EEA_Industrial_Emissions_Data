## DIOXIN & EMISSIONS CONTROL OPPORTUNITIES

### Critical Insight: Flue Gas Cleaning Evolution

The ecoprog 2024-2025 report identifies **flue gas cleaning systems as a critical technology differentiator**:

1. **Traditional systems** (pre-2010): Basic baghouses, electrostatic precipitators
   - Limited dioxin capture capability
   - Memory effect not addressed
   - De novo synthesis not prevented

2. **Modern APCD systems** (2010-present):
   - Activated carbon injection (ACI)
   - Advanced baghouses with temperature control
   - I-TEQ/TEQ continuous monitoring
   - Heat recovery integration

### Regulatory Drivers

**Europe**: Industrial Emissions Directive (IED)
- **Legal Limit**: 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm³
- **BAT Target**: 0.05 ng I-TEQ/Nm³ (2019 BAT Conclusions)
- **Enforcement**: Active, €5M+ penalties per violation

**Asia**: Mixed/Emerging Standards
- **China**: Rapidly tightening standards (2025+ targets lower dioxin limits)
- **Japan**: Historical compliance, aging plants at risk
- **SE Asia**: Weak enforcement BUT EU export restrictions driving upgrades

**North America**: EPA Limits
- **Legal Limit**: Similar to EU (0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm³)
- **Enforcement**: Less aggressive than EU but increasing

## GMAB OPPORTUNITY SIZING

### Aging Asset Base = Upgrade Cycle

**Critical Finding**: Global WtE fleet is 20+ years old on average

**Upgrade Timeline**:
- 2024-2030: **Major refresh cycle** for European plants (Germany, France, UK aging faster)
- 2025-2035: Chinese and Japanese plants reaching end-of-life replacement phase
- 2030-2040: North American aging plants due for major capital investments

### Dioxin Compliance as Trigger

1. **Existing Plants at Risk**:
   - Aging grate furnaces = higher de novo synthesis risk
   - Worn-out baghouses = incomplete dioxin capture
   - No temperature control = memory effect accumulation

2. **New Regulations Driving Action**:
   - EU BAT Conclusions deadline (2023, already in enforcement mode)
   - China's 2025-2030 emissions tightening
   - Circular economy focus = higher incineration + stricter limits

3. **Customer Motivation**:
   - Avoid 5-10 million EUR penalties per violation
   - Maintain operational permits (production shutdowns possible)
   - Meet customer waste supply chain requirements

### Market Addressable by GMAB

**Conservative Estimate**:
- **600-900 plants** in mature markets (Europe, N. America, developed Asia) likely to need APCD upgrades within 10 years
- **Each upgrade**: €12-18M APCD-focused system (GMAB positioning)
- **Total TAM**: €7.2B - €16.2B (dioxin control focus alone)

**Plus energy recovery upside**: €2-4B additional revenue from integrated heat recovery
